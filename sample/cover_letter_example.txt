Hello Team,


You're building a great feedback organization product I think has great potential, you have a small but dedicated team and you are wondering why you should hire me to fill the Full Stack Developer position.
Here's why:
• I have 5+ years experience building software and 3+ years' experience working with frameworks like React, Redux, MongoDB. Okay maybe that's not enough, everybody seems to have those these days.
• I have close to 2 years of startup experience, so I know what it means to wear many hats, still ship code in response to user needs' and changing market situation and all the while still bootstrapping. Still not good enough? Keep reading...
• I've worked on a number of real world applications used by more than 2 million users so I've dealt with real world performance and scalability issues. If this piques your interest, then maybe this technical summary for a performance optimization I did at Chegg may interest you too.
• I hold a masters in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University which speaks to my sound technical knowledge and understanding of core computer science fundamentals. Please tell me you're willing to consider by now...
• I'll add to the diversity on your team and research has shown that diversity often makes for better, more successful teams.
If by now, I've given you a reason to consider my application and I really hope I have, then kindly go through my resume attached. If not, then just maybe I'm not a good fit for you :).
I hope to hear from you soon.

Hello Team,


You're building a great online learning organization that I think has great potential, you have a small but dedicated team and you are wondering why you should accept me as a student for the 10x Applied Data Science Academy.
Here's why:
• I have 1+ years experience building Saas products using Data Science techniques such as creating reporting dashboards in production and deploying machine learning models. Okay maybe that's not enough, everybody seems to have those these days.
• I have been endorsed by Lambda School, so I know what it means to be enrolled and be accountable for attending a long-term online learning program.
• I have 9 years of work experience both working full-time at various companies and having my own business working for myself.
• I hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Rhode Island School of Design and know what it is like to go from being an artist to rise into a senior-level technical role as a 3D Technical Artist, catering to the needs of the market.
• I'll add to the diversity on your team and research has shown that diversity often makes for better, more successful teams.
If by now, I've given you a reason to consider my application and I really hope I have, then please kindly review my resume attached. I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
